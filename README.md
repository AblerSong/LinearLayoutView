# LinearLayoutView
LinearLayout  tableHeaderView

The height of the tableHeaderView can be made to adapt very easily.
With a small amount of code, it achieves a great effect, and it can be used just like a LinearLayout.

```
    
    lazy var stackView = {
        LinearLayoutView(tableView: tableView)
    }()

```
